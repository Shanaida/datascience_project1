Loan Approval Rates and Influencing Factors in India

Loan Approval Rates in 2019 was 77%. Approved loans include unused offers and approved loan statues. 

Macroeconomic and demographic factors potentially influence the probability of loans in India being approved. These factors include:
  Education and Occupation Status
  Age
  Stock Market Performance

Loan details in relation to the applicant also potentially influence the probability of loans in India being approved. These factors include:
  Type of Loan
  Amount of the Loan
  
Summary and Findings

Credit applicants who are more advanced in age and who hold secondary degrees are more likely to get approved for loans in India based on the 2019 dataset but not for all loans types. These applicants are more likely to be approved for consumer loans rather than cash and revolving credit loans.

While there is a correlation between macroeconomic factors such as the stock market performance and approval rates, we suggest additional studies to confirm a conclusion that strong market performance could indicate a higher probability of loans being approved.
